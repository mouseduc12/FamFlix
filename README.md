First Personnal API: FIRST UPPDATED
Have search button to search the movie year and display it in search(API did not provide to get data by title). 
Bug with unclickable arrows so already remove it.
Will update the responsive website soon... 

Replicate NetFlix web page challenge with REACT. Scrollable, elegant fonts, etc...
Still have few bugs as like(Search button, Arrows unclickable,...) and responsive as well.
Only import 36 movies from the API.
Will be updating in few more days.
